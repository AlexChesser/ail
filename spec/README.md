# AIL Specification — Navigation Index

> **ail** — Alexander's Impressive Loops
> *The executive function layer for LLM agents.*

## Why This Is Split

The full spec (~2200 lines) and runner spec (~250 lines) are split into per-section files to keep LLM context costs low. When working with `ail`, you rarely need the entire spec — you need one or two sections at a time. Find the section below, read only that file.

To reassemble the full spec as a single document:

```bash
cat spec/core/s*.md        # full pipeline language spec
cat spec/runner/r*.md      # full runner contract spec
```
